🧠 AI-Based Lip Reading System
📖 Overview

The AI-Based Lip Reading System is an advanced machine learning project
that interprets human lip movements and converts them into corresponding text.
This project aims to assist hearing- and speech-impaired
individuals and enhance speech recognition in noisy environments using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

The model analyzes video frames focusing on the lip region, extracts visual features, 
predicts the spoken words using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
